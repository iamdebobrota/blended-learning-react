## Segment-1 type Explanation

### script-1
Hey everyone, Hope you all are doing well. I'm Ayaz Noori, and I'll be your guide through the basics of React today. We'll cover declarative vs. imperative programming, JSX, Babel, interpolation, JS DOM vs. React DOM, and props. Starting with Declarative programming, So in React Declarative programming means telling React what you want to happen and letting it figure out the best way to do it, like putting a destination into a GPS and letting it find the best route for you. On the other hand, imperative programming in React involves giving React specific instructions on how to change the webpage, similar to giving detailed driving directions instead of just stating your destination.

  **Declarative vs. Imperative Programming in React**
  - **Declarative Programming:**
    - Defines what you want to achieve.
    - Allows React to handle how to achieve it.
    - Example: Writing JSX components in React.
  - **Imperative Programming:**
    - Involves giving React explicit instructions.
    - Requires manual manipulation of the DOM.
    - Example: Direct DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript.
  - **Key Differences:**
    - Declarative focuses on the "what".
    - Imperative focuses on the "how".

### slide-3
**Question**
What distinguishes declarative programming from imperative programming in React?
**Options**
- a) Declarative specifies how to manipulate the DOM, while imperative focuses on the desired outcome.
- b) Declarative focuses on the step-by-step process, while imperative focuses on the desired outcome.
- c) Declarative allows React to handle how to achieve the desired outcome, while imperative involves manual DOM manipulation.
- d) Declarative involves manual DOM manipulation, while imperative allows React to handle how to achieve the desired outcome.

**Answer**
c) Declarative allows React to handle how to achieve the desired outcome, while imperative involves manual DOM manipulation.
