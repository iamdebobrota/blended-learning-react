## Segment-1 type Explanation

### script-1
Let's simplify the comparison between using JavaScript with the DOM and using React with ReactDOM. When you're using plain JavaScript with the DOM, you're directly manipulating elements on the webpage. It's like working with tools in a workshop to build something from scratch. On the other hand, when you use React with ReactDOM, you're creating reusable components that represent parts of your UI. It's like assembling pre-made parts to build something quickly and efficiently. React takes care of updating the DOM efficiently, so you don't have to worry about the nitty-gritty details.

  **JS and DOM vs. React and ReactDOM**
  - **JavaScript with the DOM:**
    - Directly manipulates elements on the webpage.
    - Requires manual handling of updates and state.
    - Example: `document.getElementById('root').innerHTML = 'Hello, world!'`.
  - **React with ReactDOM:**
    - Builds reusable components to represent UI elements.
    - Abstracts away DOM manipulation details.
    - Example: `<App />` renders an entire application component.
  - **Key Differences:**
    - Manual DOM manipulation vs. Component-based approach.
    - Handling updates vs. Automatic updates by React.
