## Segment-1 type Explanation

### script-1
Let's unravel the connection between JSX and Babel. JSX, in the realm of React development, allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It's a convenient way to create UI components. However, browsers don't understand JSX directly, so we need a tool like Babel to translate JSX into regular JavaScript that browsers can interpret. Think of JSX as a language that makes your code more readable and Babel as a translator that converts it into a language browsers understand.
