## Segment-1 type Explanation

### script-1
Let's simplify the concept of interpolation in React. Interpolation allows you to embed JavaScript expressions within JSX, enabling dynamic content rendering. It's like filling in the blanks with real-time data. For example, if you want to display a user's name dynamically, you can use interpolation to inject the JavaScript expression that fetches the user's name. This way, your UI stays up-to-date with the latest data without manually updating it.
