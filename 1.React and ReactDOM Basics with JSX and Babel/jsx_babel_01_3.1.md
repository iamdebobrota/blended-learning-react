## Segment-1 type Explanation

### script-1

Let's simplify the connection between JSX and Babel. JSX lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript, making it easier to create UI components in React. However, browsers can't understand JSX directly, so we use Babel to translate JSX into regular JavaScript that browsers can understand. Think of JSX like a special language for writing React components, and Babel as the tool that translates this special language into something browsers can read.
