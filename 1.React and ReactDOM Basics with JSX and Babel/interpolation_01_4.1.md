## Segment-1 type Explanation

### script-1

Let's simplify what interpolation means in React. Interpolation is like a magic trick that lets you put dynamic values into your JSX. It's like having placeholders in your text that you can fill in with real data when your app runs. For instance, if you want to greet a user by name, you can use interpolation to insert their name into the greeting message. This way, your app can personalize its messages based on the user's information.
