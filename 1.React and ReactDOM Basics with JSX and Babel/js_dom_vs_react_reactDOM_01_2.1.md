## Segment-1 type Explanation

### script-1
Let's simplify the difference between using plain JavaScript with the DOM and using React with ReactDOM. When you work with plain JavaScript and the DOM, it's like building something from scratch using tools directly on a workbench. You have to handle every detail, from shaping the materials to putting them together. On the other hand, when you use React with ReactDOM, it's like assembling pre-made parts to build something quickly. React takes care of most of the work for you, so you can focus on putting those parts together to create your project.
