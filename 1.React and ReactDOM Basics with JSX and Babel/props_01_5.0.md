## Segment-1 type Explanation

### script-1
Let's simplify the concept of props in React. Props, short for "properties," are like information packets that you can send to React components. They allow you to pass data from one component to another. Think of props as messages you give to different parts of your app, telling them what to display or how to behave. For example, if you have a component for displaying a user's profile, you can use props to pass the user's name, picture, and other details to that component.
