## Segment-1 type Explanation

### script-1
Let's break down the difference between two ways of telling React what to do: declarative and imperative. When you use declarative programming, you're like saying, "Hey React, here's what I want the final result to look like, you figure out how to make it happen." It's a bit like giving someone a picture and asking them to paint it. On the other hand, imperative programming is more like giving step-by-step instructions, like telling someone exactly which brush strokes to make to paint the picture.

  **Declarative vs. Imperative Programming in React**
  - **Declarative Programming:**
    - Tells React what you want the outcome to be.
    - React figures out how to achieve it.
    - Example: Writing JSX components in React.
  - **Imperative Programming:**
    - Gives React specific instructions.
    - Requires telling React every little step.
    - Example: Directly changing the DOM using vanilla JavaScript.
  - **Key Differences:**
    - Declarative focuses on the result.
    - Imperative focuses on how to get there.
