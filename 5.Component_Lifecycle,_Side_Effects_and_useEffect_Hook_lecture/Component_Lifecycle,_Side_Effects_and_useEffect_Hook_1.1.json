      "script": "Today's session is like embarking on an adventure into the world of React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Our focus will be on a tool called Create React App, which is the equivalent of a trusty backpack that carries all the essentials you need for your journey into development.\n\nWhy use Create React App? Imagine you're going on a hike. Sure, you could gather all the gear yourself\u2014map, boots, supplies\u2014but it's far easier if you have a pre-packed backpack with everything you need. Create React App sets up your development environment, providing a standard structure for your project, including configurations for bundling, linting, and development server. You can start creating immediately, without getting bogged down in setup details.\n\nAnd how do we use it? Well, it's surprisingly straightforward. With a few commands in your terminal, you can create a new React project that's ready to be shaped into your vision. It's as easy as choosing your path on a well-marked trail.\n\nAs we move throughout this lecture, we'll explore how components in React have a lifecycle, akin to seasons in a year, each with its own purpose and activities. Then, we'll learn about side effects\u2014actions that take place outside the local scope of the function\u2014akin to a hiker interacting with the environment. Finally, we'll introduce the useEffect hook, a powerful ally that lets us manage these side effects in our React components like a skilled navigator.\n\nBy the end of this journey, you'll understand why Create React App is your starting point for React projects and how to effectively use React's component lifecycle and the useEffect hook to create engaging and dynamic web experiences.",
