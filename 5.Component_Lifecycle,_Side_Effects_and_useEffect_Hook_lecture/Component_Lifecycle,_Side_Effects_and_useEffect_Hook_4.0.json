      "script": "In today's session, we are going to unravel the workings of a powerful feature in React's arsenal \u2013 the useEffect hook, specifically focusing on its role in the component lifecycle during the update phase and the importance of cleanup functions.\n\nImagine a React component like a biologist's lab, where multiple experiments (side-effects) can occur while observing a specimen (our UI). Just as a lab must be maintained to ensure accurate results, our components need to manage side-effects to prevent bugs and memory leaks.\n\nThe useEffect hook allows us to add these side-effects, such as fetching data, subscribing to services, or manually changing the DOM, which are not part of the normal render flow. And during the update phase, when our component changes due to state or props alteration, useEffect carefully determines when to re-run these side-effects, based on dependencies we provide.\n\nBut what happens to side-effects that should only run once or need to be cleaned up before running again? This is where cleanup functions come into play. They are the protocols for safely dismantling an experiment (side-effect) to ensure the lab (our component) is ready for its next task without any residual impact from the previous one.\n\nBy the end of our discussion, you will have a clear understanding of how to effectively harness the power of useEffect to handle side-effects in your React components, and crucially, how to clean them up to maintain robust and healthy components.",
