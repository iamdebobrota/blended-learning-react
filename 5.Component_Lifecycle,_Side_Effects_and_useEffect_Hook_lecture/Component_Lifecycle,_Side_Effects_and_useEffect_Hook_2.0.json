      "script": "In today's session, we will be unwrapping the inner workings of React components through an exploration of Component Lifecycle, Side Effects, and the useEffect Hook. React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, guides components through a series of well-defined lifecycle stages. Each lifecycle stage is like a checkpoint in a component's journey, allowing developers to tap into key moments and perform custom behaviors.\n\nAs we embark on this journey, think of React components as actors on a stage, each with their own scripts and cues to follow. When a component makes its first appearance, it's 'born' into the application through the mounting phase. When its role needs to change, it updates accordingly, and when its part is over, it unmounts, exiting the stage gracefully. In these phases, we can intervene with our own code to affect the performance (behavior) of our components.\n\nA critical twist in this plot is when components have to deal with side effects - operations that reach out of the React world for data, subscriptions, or other interactions with the external world. To manage these side effects elegantly, React provides us with the useEffect Hook, allowing components to respond to changes and orchestrate their tasks without disrupting the main show.\n\nBy the end of our session, you'll understand the lifecycles of a React component, how to handle side effects, and effectively use the useEffect Hook, setting the stage for more dynamic and responsive applications.",
