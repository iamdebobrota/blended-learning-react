      "script": "Today, we'll unwrap the concepts of Component Lifecycle, Side Effects, and the useEffect Hook in React - important for managing a component's birth, growth, and death in our applications. Think of components like characters in a play, making entrances (mounting), changing costumes or roles (updating), and eventually leaving the stage (unmounting).\n\nReact components go through this lifecycle, and with the useEffect Hook, we give them 'superpowers' to interact with the outside world - these interactions are what we call side effects. They can do things like fetching data, setting up subscriptions, or manually changing the Document Object Model (DOM).\n\nSpecifically, useEffect lets us plug into different phases of a component's life. When it first appears, that's the Mount Phase. As it updates, due to changes in state or props, we have the Update Phase. Finally, when the component says goodbye, that's the Unmount Phase. Grasping these concepts helps us write components that behave correctly throughout their lifecycle. Get ready to see how all these pieces fit together in a harmony that keeps our apps functioning smoothly!",
