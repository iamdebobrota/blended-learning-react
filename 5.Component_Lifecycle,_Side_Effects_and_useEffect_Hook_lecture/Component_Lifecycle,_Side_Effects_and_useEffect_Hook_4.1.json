      "script": "Today we're going to look into a crucial aspect of React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces \u2013 we are talking about the Component Lifecycle, Side Effects, and the useEffect Hook. These are features that help manage and understand how your components behave across their lifespan within your application.\n\nImagine a component as a person going through different stages of life - each stage represents a phase in the lifecycle of a React component. The useEffect Hook, in particular, is like scheduling daily tasks, such as calling friends or going to the gym. It allows you to perform side effects in your components, which are operations that can affect other components or cannot be done during rendering.\n\nThe 'Cleanup' is an essential part of useEffect, which is like cleaning up after dinner, ensuring that things remain in order for the next day. Cleanup functions in React help prevent memory leaks and other issues by cleaning up resources used by the component before it's unmounted or before the useEffect runs again.\n\nBy the end of this talk, you'll have a clear understanding of how to use the useEffect Hook effectively for handling side effects, how to clean them up, and how this all plays a vital role during the update phase of a component\u2019s lifecycle.",
