To non-tech savvy individuals, imagine deciding to build a house. You could acquire all materials separately and plan the construct from scratch, blueprint included. \n\nWhy use Create React App? First, it manages the build setup for you. No need to worry about setting up Webpack or Babel \u2013 it's all done! Second, it provides a solid foundation to scale up with best practices and optimized performance. And third, it's officially supported by the React team, ensuring reliability.\n\nNow, in the context of our lecture on Component Lifecycle, Side Effects, and useEffect Hook, understanding when and why to employ Create React App is pivotal. It directly influences how you manage side effects and lifecycle processes in your application. By the end of this lecture, you will not only understand the convenience of Create React App, but also how it influences the way you handle components and side effects in your reactive house of cards.",
