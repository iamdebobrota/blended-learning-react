      "script": "In today's session, we will introduce the dynamic world of React and its component lifecycle. React is like a director of a play, coordinating the appearance, actions, and exit of the characters, which in our case are the components of your application.\n\nEach React component has a lifecycle, a series of events that happen from the birth of the component to its death. Think about it like a plant. First, you sow a seed (component creation), then you water and take care of it as it grows (component update), and finally, it withers away (component unmounting).\n\nBut not all plants require the same amount of water or sunlight. Similarly, components also need to interact with the outside world, like fetching data from an API or subscribing to a service; in React, we call these 'side effects'. React provides us with a hook named useEffect to handle these side effects efficiently.\n\nBy the end of this lecture, you\u2019ll have a deeper understanding of how React components are born, grow, and say goodbye, as well as how to manage the side effects within these components to create a smooth and responsive app experience.",
