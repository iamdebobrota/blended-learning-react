      "script": "Today, we'll embark on an enriching journey into the world of React, focusing on the Component Lifecycle, Side Effects, and the powerful useEffect Hook. Understanding these concepts is like learning how to manage a crew on a ship \u2014 knowing when to hire (Mount phase), when to train or update (Update phase) the crew members, and when to say goodbye or retire (Unmount phase) them efficiently.\n\nFirst, we'll examine the Component Lifecycle, the series of events that occur from the birth to death of a React component. It's like the life story of a character in a play, from the time they step onto the stage until they make their final exit.\n\nThen, we'll discuss Side Effects, those extra tasks that need to be handled alongside the main work, like sending signals to other ships or managing resources on board.\n\nFinally, we arrive at the useEffect Hook, a tool in React's arsenal that allows us to handle side effects in functional components. It's like having a trusted officer on the deck who ensures that all additional tasks are taken care of, at the right time and in the right way.\n\nBy the end of this session, you'll understand the importance of ensuring that components are properly managed throughout their lifecycle, how side effects influence your React applications, and how to harness the power of useEffect to maintain a clean and efficient codebase.",
