      "script": "In today's lesson, we'll unravel the mysteries of state management in React applications by focusing on the useState hook. Managing the state is like having a whiteboard in a classroom. It holds data that can be read, erased, or changed during the course of interaction. This is fundamental in React applications where components need to react to user input, server responses, or other actions.\n\nState management techniques are your toolbox for ensuring that the right data is accessible to the right components at the right time. The useState hook, in particular, is like a personal notepad for individual components. It allows them to hold onto their information, remember it, and update it as needed without losing track as the user interacts with the app.\n\nBy the end of today\u2019s session, you\u2019ll understand how components in React share data using useState, making your applications dynamic and responsive. We\u2019ll explore practical examples, and you\u2019ll learn to manage the state like a pro, adapting your app to the needs of your users with ease and precision.",
