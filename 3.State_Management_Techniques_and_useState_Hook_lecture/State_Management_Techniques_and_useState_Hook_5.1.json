      "script": "Today's lesson is about an important concept in React.js, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces \u2013 we're talking about State Management and the useState Hook. State management is like the memory of an application. Imagine you're playing a video game, and you decide to pause and grab a snack. When you return and hit resume, you expect the game to be exactly as you left it. That's what state management does for an application; it keeps track of all the changes and interactions,\n\nNow, in React.js, components are like individual puzzle pieces that make up the whole picture of your application. Sharing data between these components can sometimes be a challenge when they're not directly related. This is where the useState Hook comes into play. It's a special function that lets you add React state to function components.\n\nThe useState Hook is like giving each component its little notepad, where it can jot down important stuff it should remember. By the end of this session, you'll understand how useState allows components to hold onto and manage their own state, and how various components in your application can communicate and share data effectively.",
