      "script": "Today, we're going to delve into an intriguing aspect of React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces - specifically, we'll focus on state management techniques and the useState hook. Within this framework, there are two distinct ways to handle form elements, known as Controlled and Uncontrolled Components.\n\nLet's think of Controlled Components as pets on a leash \u2013 you have full control over them. In React, these are form elements like <input>, <textarea>, and <select> that are controlled by the state within the component. We directly manage their state and respond to every change, typically through the useState hook.\n\nOn the other hand, Uncontrolled Components are like free-roaming animals in nature \u2013 they manage themselves. These are form elements that keep their own state internally and are queried using a ref when needed. We do not directly manage the state of these elements through state updates in the component.\n\nWe'll dive into practical examples of using useState to control components, the benefits of each approach, and their best use cases. By the end of this session, you'll be equipped to manage state effectively in your React applications and understand when to use controlled versus uncontrolled components.",
