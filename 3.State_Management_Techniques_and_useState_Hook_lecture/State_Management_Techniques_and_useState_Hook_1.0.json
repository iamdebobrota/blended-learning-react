Today, we're going to unpack the useState hook - a fundamental hook in React that allows you to add state to your functional components.\n\nImagine you're reading a book, and you use a bookmark to remember the page you're on. useState is like that bookmark, but for your component. It lets you keep track of information, and just as you might move the bookmark as you read further, useState allows your component to change its remembered information as the user interacts with your app.\n\nBefore hooks were introduced, state could only be used in class components. This meant you had to understand more complex concepts like 'this' keyword, lifecycle methods, and more. But now, with useState, you can manage state in a simpler, more elegant way.\n\nBy the end of our session, you'll know how to make your components dynamic and responsive to user actions using the useState hook. You'll learn how to declare state variables, update them, and use those updates to make your app interactive and alive.",
