      "script": "In this lesson, we are going to understand a powerful feature in React called the useState Hook. React is a popular library for building user interfaces, and useState is a tool that allows us to manage state in our applications effectively.\n\nYou can think of state as the memory of a component in your application. It's like a character in a story who can remember past events and use them to decide what to do next. With useState, we can keep track of these events and pieces of information in our components, which can change over time due to user interactions or other factors.\n\nThe useState Hook gives components in React the ability to remember things by setting up a 'state variable'. It's as if we're giving our component a personal notebook to jot down notes and update them whenever necessary. We'll explore how this works in practice and see useState in action, allowing our components to dynamically display information and respond to users.\n\nBy the end of this lecture, you'll have a clear picture of how useState makes our React components interactive and responsive. This understanding is crucial not just for this lesson, but for your journey as a modern web developer using React.",
