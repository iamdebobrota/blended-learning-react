      "script": "Welcome to our lesson on state management in React! Today, we're going to unravel the mystery behind Controlled and Uncontrolled Components. Imagine you're at a concert. In a controlled environment, the sound engineer adjusts every note and beat, creating the perfect audio experience. Similarly, a Controlled Component is like that sound engineer, ensuring the form data is handled by React\u2019s state. \n\nConversely, Uncontrolled Components are like an impromptu jam session \u2013 no one is steering the ship, and the DOM itself manages the data. It\u2019s freestyle with fewer restrictions, but also less predictable. We will also learn how to harness React's useState hook, which lets us keep track of state in our functional components, much like a maestro keeping time in an orchestra, ensuring harmony and coordination.\n\nBy the end of this session, you'll be able to decide when to use controlled or uncontrolled components and manage state in your React applications with confidence and finesse.",
