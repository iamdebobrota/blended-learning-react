      "script": "In today's session, we'll be exploring how to manage forms, lists, and keys in React, and incorporate the Axios library to make network requests, particularly to a JSON server. Imagine you're organizing a library of books. Each book has a unique identifier, like the ISBN, and contains information like the title and author. React forms are like the forms you would fill out to add a new book to the library, lists represent the shelves of books you can scroll through, and keys are like the ISBN numbers, helping React efficiently update the UI.\n\nAxios comes in as the diligent librarian, fetching and returning books from a vast network of libraries \u2013 in our case, making HTTP requests to retrieve or store data on a web server. As we move forward, you'll learn to craft web forms with React, display lists of data using keys, and use Axios to integrate with a JSON server. By mastering these tools, you'll be equipped to create dynamic and responsive web applications.",
