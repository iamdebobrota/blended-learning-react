      "script": "Hello bright minds! Today we're going to delve into the practical and powerful tools within React and the Axios library to enhance your web development skills. React allows you to build dynamic web applications with ease, and when combined with Axios, a popular library for making HTTP requests, you get a supercharged development experience.\n\nWe will start by looking at React forms which are essential for capturing user inputs efficiently. Then, we'll learn how to display lists of data smoothly with React's unique key props system that optimizes rendering and ensures your app runs fast and smooth. Afterward, we will introduce Axios for making network requests to fetch, post, or manipulate data on servers.\n\nBy utilizing a simple yet powerful tool like JSON Server, we will simulate a real backend for our exercises, giving you a near-real experience of working with APIs. After our session, you'll be equipped to create more interactive and responsive web applications that feel seamless to users. Let's get started and unlock these new skills together!",
