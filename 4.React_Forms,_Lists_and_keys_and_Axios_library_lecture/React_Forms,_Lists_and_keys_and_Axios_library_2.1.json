      "script": "In today's session, we're going to unravel the magic of list rendering in React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React thrives on components \u2013 they are like the building blocks of a Lego set. Just like you can combine different Lego pieces to create a structure, React components can be combined to build robust applications.\n\nSpecifically, we'll explore how to display lists \u2013 collections of data, such as an array of names, numbers, or objects. Have you ever made a grocery list or a to-do list? In React, we can create similar lists on web pages!\n\nBut how do we show this list to the user? We will use the JavaScript 'map' function, which transforms each item in an array into HTML elements. It's akin to decorating every item on your grocery list with a colorful sticky note to make it stand out!\n\nAlongside, we'll also answer two key questions: How do we uniquely identify each item, and why is it important? This is where 'keys' come in handy. They are like name tags for list items, helping React to efficiently update the user interface.\n\nLastly, we will peek into the Axios library \u2013 a tool that fetches data from the web, like a postman delivers your mail. With Axios, we can grab our list of data from a server and display it in our React application.\n\nBy the end of our class, you'll be equipped to create dynamic lists in React, improving user interaction in the applications you build.",
