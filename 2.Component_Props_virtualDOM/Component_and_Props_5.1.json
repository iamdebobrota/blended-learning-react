      "script": "Welcome to a foundational concept that bridges design patterns and component architecture in modern web development \u2013 Children Props in React. Now, Children Props might sound like something intricate, but fear not; we're going to break it down into simple parts.\n\nConsider a toy box; it can contain an assortment of toys. In React, 'children' is like that toy box, which can include any number of components arranged inside a parent component. This allows us to create versatile structures where the encapsulating parent doesn't need to know what's inside the children.\n\nNow, talking about higher-order components (HOCs), imagine a school bus. The bus is a vehicle designed to transport any number of students \u2013 that could be you! Here, the bus is the HOC that 'wraps' around the students, enabling additional functionalities like picking up students from multiple locations.\n\nUsing the 'children' keyword in React, we create HOCs by passing the 'children' prop to wrap around any component, thereby creating a new component with additional powers. Essentially, it's like giving the school bus a GPS system to navigate through city traffic more effectively.\n\nBy the end of this lesson, you\u2019ll understand how Children Props can be leveraged to compose complex interfaces flexibly and how they are crucial in creating HOCs in React.",
