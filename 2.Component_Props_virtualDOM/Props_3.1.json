      "script": "Today, we'll embark on an interesting journey into the React framework, particularly focusing on one of its key features known as 'props'. Imagine for a moment that our data is like a letter, and React components are houses in a neighborhood. \n\nProps, which stands for properties, act like mail carriers, delivering this letter to the right house or component. They are a mechanism for passing data from parent to child components, or even among sibling components, ensuring that each part of our application displays the correct information.\n\nThink of it like delegating tasks in a group project, where each person needs specific details to do their part. Props allow us to share these details across different members of the team, in this case, our components. By the end of our session, you will understand how props enable components to communicate and work together harmoniously to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces in React applications.",
