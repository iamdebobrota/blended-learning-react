      "script": "Today, we'll be demystifying a critical concept in the world of web development with React \u2013 Components. Much like building a house requires different materials such as bricks, wood, and glass, constructing a React application involves creating and combining different parts, which we call Components.\n\nComponents are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML via a render function. Imagine them as custom, reusable HTML elements that you can use throughout your application.\n\nThe beauty of Components lies in their modularity and reusability. Instead of writing a massive, tangled web of code, you can break down your UI into manageable, self-contained pieces. Each piece, or component, has its own logic and controls its own rendering, similar to puzzle pieces that fit together but are individually complete.\n\nBy the end of today's lecture, you will grasp why Components are such a game-changer in React applications, making code more manageable, easier to maintain, and much more scalable.",
