Today's discussion shines a light on a fundamental concept in the React.js framework \u2013 Components. Now Lets discuss about React components, React's power lies in its ability to break down the UI into reusable pieces called components, much like how a Lego set consists of interlocking bricks. Each component is responsible for rendering a portion of the user interface, allowing for effective management of complex interfaces by assembling these building blocks together.\n\nImagine you're arranging a party and you've got decorations, food, and music to organize. Think of each of these aspects as components of your party. Similarly, in a React application, you have various components like a navigation bar, a user profile card, or a comments section, each encapsulating design, behavior, and state.\n\n Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML. Components in React come in two types: 'Functional' and 'Class-based'. The beauty of components is in their reusability \u2013 once you create a component, you can use it multiple times across different parts of your app like using the same decoration set for different events.",
